Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX_particle_gen.C
----------------------------------
This is a copy of the Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX macro, which I cleaned up a bit and configured to run the event generator.
Copy this macro into and run from macros/macros/g4simulations/.

run_shared_pim_sPHENIX.sh
sPHENIX_shifter.sh
----------------------------------
These scripts can be used to run the macro above, after it has been moved to the proper directory.
